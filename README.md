Simplegauges
============

Simple gauges for use with SignalK server. Install with 

`bower install https://github.com/SignalK/simplegauges.git`

Developing
==========
Simplegauges uses a build tool called `gulp` to package all the js source files into one under `dist/gauges.js`.

If you want to just tinker around you can edit directly `dist/gauges.js` and reload your browser.

If you want your changes to persist over reinstalls you can 
* fork the repository on Github
* install your own fork
* make the changes in `gauges.js`, package the `dist/gauges.js` with `gulp` and then refresh your browser
* commit the changes to your own repo 

and hopefully eventually

* contribute your additions back to the main instrumentpanel repository by creating a Github Pull Request.
